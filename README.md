# Airbnb Dashboard

This project is a Tableau dashboard I created to explore and analyze Airbnb listings data. It provides key insights into pricing, availability trends, and estimated revenue over time.

## Overview

As part of my data analytics learning journey, I built this dashboard to better understand how data visualization can support decision-making in the hospitality industry. The dashboard presents:

- Average prices across different regions and property types  
- Listing availability by month  
- Annual revenue estimations based on booking trends

## Tools Used

- Tableau for data visualization  
- Excel for data cleaning and preparation

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights using visual tools. It also reflects my growing skills in working with real-world datasets.
